        <blockquote class="capyo">Steven Grant "Steve" Rogers is a World War II veteran,and is known as the world's first superhero.<br> 
        Born within Brooklyn, New York City, the young Rogers had suffered from numerous health problems,<br> 
        and upon America's entry into World War II, was rejected from military service despite several attempts to enlist.<br> 
        Determined to serve, he ultimately volunteered for the top-secret Super Soldier program,<br> 
        and the frail Rogers was then enhanced to the peak of human perfection.</blockquote><br> 
        Rogers soon joined the war effort as the mascot, given the new moniker of Captain America,<br> 
        and later joined the war with a combat role after he single-handedly liberated captured Allied POWs.</p>
