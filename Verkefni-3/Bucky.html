        <p><blockquote>Sergeant James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes was a former soldier of the 107th<br> 
            Regiment and the best friend of Steve Rogers, since childhood.<br> 
            Barnes was conscripted and assigned to the 107th in 1942.<br>
            His regiment was captured by the forces of <strong>HYDRA</strong>, but Barnes along with what remained of his regiment were rescued by Rogers,<br> 
            who had become <strong>Captain America</strong> during Barnes' military absence.<br>
            Joining forces in the continuing war, Barnes and Rogers formed the Howling Commandos to battle the Red Skull's forces.<br>
            During an attempt to capture <strong>HYDRA</strong> scientist Arnim Zola,<br> 
            Barnes was caught in an ambush and plummeted hundreds of feet from the <strong>HYDRA</strong> train.<br> 
            As no body was ever recovered, he was then presumed dead, but officially listed as <strong>MIA</strong></blockquote></p>
