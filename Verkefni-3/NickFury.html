         <blockquote><h1>NICK FURY</h1> Nicholas "Nick" Joseph Fury was a former Colonel who had served with the United States Army and an espionage veteran of the CIA during the Cold War.<br> 
            Continuing to serve the world, Fury joined S.H.I.E.L.D.,<br> 
            a covert international peacekeeping organization which operates as humanity's first line of defense against Earth's most dangerous enemies<br> 
            until he was promoted to the position of Director.<br> 
            From this position, Fury refocused his efforts on organising the Avengers<br> 
            Initiative with intentions of bringing together any super powered individuals who could protect the world from any threat.<br> 
            Despite some considerable reluctance from World Security Council members, Fury had still continued all his efforts and eventually managed to recruit both Iron Man and Captain America into their Initiative.</blockquote>
