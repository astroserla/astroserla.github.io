        is one of the most talented spies and assassins in the entire world and a founding member of the Avengers.<br> 
        Originally an agent of the Soviet agency for foreign intelligence, the KGB, she later became a member of S.H.I.E.L.D., the international counter-intelligence agency.<br> 
        Having extensive mastery in martial arts and armed with her Widow's Bite, Black Widow became one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most efficient agents.<br> 
        During one mission, she was sent undercover into Stark Industries to watch Tony Stark due to fears that he was dying.<br> 
        During this mission, Romanoff had assisted Stark with defeating Ivan Vanko's terrorist plots against him</p></blockquote>
